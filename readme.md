# Krunker Bulk Quick Sell Script

Ever got tired of clicking through dozens of items one by one when selling blue and purple in Krunker? Yeah, me too. That's why I made this script.

## What does it do?

Simply put, it lets you select multiple items in your inv and sell them all at once instead of the boring one-by-one clicking fest.

## Features

- Adds little checkboxes to your inv tab
- Shows a neat control panel to manage everything
- "Select All" button because every skins sucks
- Automatically picks "All items" when selling (no more dropdown clicking)
- Tells you how many items you've selected

## How to use it

1. Copy this script and paste it into a new userscript or f12
2. Go to your Krunker inv 
3. You'll see checkboxes on your items and a control panel in the top-left
4. Check the items you want to sell
5. Hit the big red "EXECUTE QUICK SELL" button
6. Confirm and watch it do the work for you

## How it actually works

The script basically:
1. Adds checkboxes to all your inv items
2. When you hit sell, it goes through each selected item
3. Uses Krunker's own selling system (so it's not doing anything sketchy)
4. Automatically selects "All" in the popup so you don't have to
5. Clicks confirm for you
6. Moves to the next item


## Heads up

- **Double-check your selections** - once you confirm, those items are getting sold
- **Works on most browsers** - tested on Chrome and Firefox mainly

## If something breaks

- Check the browser console (F12) for any angry red text
- Make sure you're actually on the inv tab
- Try refreshing the page
- The control panel should be in the top-left corner

## Why I made this

Because its the only way to have fun with krunker (and I'm gambling addicted)

That's about it. Hope it saves you some clicking time!

*P.S. - This is just a quality-of-life improvement, not a money-making exploit or anything like that. It just makes the existing selling process less painful.*
